- create a directory under stand-alone named policy
- cp -r the contents of the git cloned console/policy directoy to /usr/local/share/qpid-dispatch/stand-alone/policy
- run npm install in the /usr/local/share/qpid-dispatch/stand-alone/policy directory

Running
====================

- Start a router with a connector that has a role of route-container, a listener that can serve http, and a linkRoute with a pattern of #/policy
  router {
      mode: stand-alone
      id: Policy
  }
  connector {
      name: policy-connector
      host: 0.0.0.0
      port: 25674
      role: route-container
      saslMechanisms: ANONYMOUS
  }
  linkRoute {
      pattern: #/policy
      connection: policy-connector
      dir: in
  }
  listener {
      host: 0.0.0.0
      port: 5674
      http: true
      role: normal
      saslMechanisms: ANONYMOUS
  }

- from the /usr/local/share/qpid-dispatch/stand-alone/policy directory run ./policy.py -a 0.0.0.0:25674 -v
- in the address bar of a browser, enter localhost:5674/policy/
