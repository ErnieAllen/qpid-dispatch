How will the UI know which vhost to request? or if no vhost should be requested?
  - If it is part of the url, should the UI prevent hacking the url to get access to other vhosts?

Right now the UI uses the address:port of the web page to get the router's host:port. This forces the UI to be served by a router. Is that OK?
  - In other words, do we want a connect page to allow connecting to a remote router if the UI is not served by a router?

Installation:
  - Should the UI be installed with the stand-alone console?
  - Should there be a CMake option to install the UI under the stand-alone console's directory?

Help/Documentation:
  - do a README

GUI:
  - refresh tree after DELETE
  - reget tree after any operation and animate changes
  - more testing
  - sort $default to top of tree level
  - reuse management connection and just create a sender and receiver for policy messages
